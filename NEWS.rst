News for Kodo
============

This file lists the major changes between versions. For a more detailed list
of every change, see the Git log.

13.0.0
------
* Major: Replaced the linear_block_decoder with the
  bidirectional_linear_block_decoder layer. The bidirectional linear
  block decoder layer uses a direction policy to determine whether to
  perform Gaussian elimination from left-to-right or
  right-to-left. Certain newer network coding algorithms can be
  implemented efficiently utilizing this flexibility. Based on the
  bidirectional layer we have added the forward and backwards linear
  block decoder.
* Minor: Added support for specifying the number of nonzero symbols in the
  sparse codes (this extends the API which previously only supported a
  fraction of nonzero symbols to be specified).
* Minor: Added generic functions for printing debug information from codec
  stacks where this functionality is supported.

12.0.0
------
* Major: Changed the partial_decoding_tracker to only provide the
  functionality needed to detect "early" or partial decoding. The
  monitor functionality has been moved to the largest_nonzero_index_decoder
  layer.
* Minor: Added the payload_rank_encoder and payload_rank_decoder layers
  which will explicitly exchange the rank of the encoder matrix and the
  decoder matrix to support partial decoding.

11.2.0
------
* Minor: Added the partial_decoding_tracker layer which "monitors" the
  coding vectors being passed to a decoder in order to detect early
  decoding opportunities. This means that although not all packets have
  yet been sent from the encoder, it might happen that we can decode
  anyway. This kind of functionality is useful especially for applications
  which require low delay.
* Minor: Added on-the-fly encoding and decoding stacks in
  src/kodo/rlnc/on_he_fly_codes.hpp the on-the-fly stacks have the advantage
  that they allow encoding and decoding to proceed even without having all
  encoding symbols available.

11.1.0
------
* Minor: Added new cached_symbol_decoder layer, this layer does not perform
  any decoding on the incoming symbol, but provides access to the encoded
  symbol's coefficients and data. An example use_cached_symbol_decoder was
  added to show a possible use case for this layer.
* Minor: Added new example showing some one way to use some of the debug
  layers in kodo. The example is in the examples folder called
  use_debug_layers
* Bug: Fix missing return in the payload_recoder recode() function.

11.0.0
------
* Minor: Added decoding probability benchmark. The benchmark measures the
  the number of symbols needed to decode from which the decoding probability
  can be derived.
* Major: Refactored the factory layers so that the layer::construct() and
  layer::initialize() functions are now template functions. The motivation for
  this is that it relaxes the layer ordering since all layers will now have
  access to the full factory type. I.e. layers lower in the stack can call
  functions on the factory defined higher in the stack. This was previously
  not possible.
* Minor: Moved the symbols and symbol_size related functions from the factory
  layers.
* Minor: Adding new overhead benchmark. The overhead benchmark profiles the
  total overhead in bytes transmitted on the wire for different code
  configurations.
* Minor: Added sparse_uniform_generator, which can we used to control the
  amount of non-zero vs zero elements generated in e.g. a RLNC encoding vector.
* Minor: Adding support for git protocol option in the wscript
* Bug: The uniform_generator and sparse_uniform_generators contained a bug which
  meant that not all symbols were considered for recoding, when rank of a
  recoder was not full.

10.0.0
------
* Bug: Fixed incorrectly failing assert in the linear_block_encoder. The assert
  was triggered during recoding when a storage for a specific symbol was not
  explicitly set by the layer::set_symbol() or layer::set_symbols() functions.
  The bug was introduced in version 9.0.1, the unit test has been updated to
  correctly detect this issue in the future.
* Major: All codec stacks using the linear_block_encoder, should now add the
  storage_aware_encoder layer below the linear_block_encoder. This is to ensure
  that the encoder is reusable for RLNC recoding.
* Major: Re-factor symbol storage API to avoid confusion about which symbols has
  been explicitly specified by the user and which have not. This information is
  now available through the symbols_available(), symbols_initialized() family
  of functions.

9.0.1
-----
* Bug: Fix behavior or deep_symbol_storage::set_symbols() to set all
  symbols.
* Bug: When reusing decoders contaning the linear_block_decoder layer
  systematic symbols where not correctly initialized. A fix was added
  to the linear_block_decoder and the unit test test_reuse_incomplete
  now checks for this issue.

9.0.0
-----
* Minor: Adding the shallow storage decoder which allows decoding objects
  larger than a single block or generation.
* Minor: Adding new example of an on-the-fly encoder. This example shows
  how to use an encoder before all symbols for that encoder has become
  available. This can be very useful in cases where data is produced
  on-the-fly, e.g. some form of streaming. The example can be found in the
  "examples/encode_on_the_fly" folder.
* Minor: Adding a deep storage decoder which provides the memory needed to
  decode a large object spanning several blocks.
* Minor: Adding simple decoding example. This example shows how to input
  symbols and coefficients directly into the decoder and how some of the
  debug layers can be applied to debug the decoding process.
* Bug: Made all factories non-copyable by making copy constructor and copy
  assignment constructor private.
* Bug: Fix issue in recoding_symbol_id, where sak::copy_storage triggered an
  assert when using an decoder with symbols less than max_symbols.
* Major: Changed construct() and initialize() functions of a coding layer to
  accept the factory as the only parameters. This breaks backwards
  compatibility with Kodo version 8.0.0.
* Major: Changed the factory build() function to accept no parameters.
  Factories are now configured e.g. using set_symbols(uint32_t) before
  calling build() to create a new encoder / decoder.
* Minor: Moved finite_field_counter layer from the benchmarks to the
  library source folder. This makes it possible to add it to any codec
  stack where the number of finite field operations should be monitored.
* Minor: Updated to waf-tools version 2.x.y
* Major: Updating dependency to gauge version 5.x.y

8.0.0
-----
* Updated layers to follow new API specifications. This change will break
  most existing layers. The API specification is available in the doxygen
  folder.
* New API for object/file encoders, makes it easier to support custom data
  sources e.g. such as memory mapped files.
* Added file encoder example.
* Replaced the old generator API with new Coefficient Generator API.
* Updated the factory APIs to pass the factory to each layer. This
  simplifies construction in several layers, where previously it was not
  possible to access the factory.
* Updated waf to 1.7.9 and enabled use of the wurf_install_path tool.

7.0.1
-----
* Fixed missing include in storage.hpp

7.0.0
-----
* Update waf to use external tools repository
* Updated waf to not use git local clones which are creating hardlinks
  that are not allowed on the "afs" filesystem

6.0.0
-----
* Bump fifi to version 6
* Bump sak to version 7

5.0.0
-----
* Bump fifi to version 5.x.y.
* Bump sak to version 6.x.y.

4.0.0
-----
* Using .hpp extension instead of .h

3.0.1
-----
* Removing asserts on symbol size. Fifi should handle symbol sizes
  not a multiple of 16.

3.0.0
-----
* Moved source files to the src folder
* Added operations counter benchmark
* Switched to use the cxx-gauge project for the benchmark code
* Bump fifi to version 3
* Bump boost to version 2
* Bump sak to version 4

2.0.1
-----
* Created linear_block_xyz codes as a building block for future and existing
  block code implementations.
* Refactored RLNC recoding functionality to utilize allow a larger re-use of
  existing code.
* Added initial version of encoding/decoding throughput benchmarks.
* Fixed Mac support in build scripts

2.0.0
-----
* Updated the Waf build system to handle dependencies better. The new tools
  used are not compatible with the old versions so we have to bump the major
  version.
