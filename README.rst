Introduction
------------

**Kodo** is a flexible C++ network coding, intended to be used for
commercial applications and for research on implementation of Network
Coding. The library enable researchers to implement, new codes and
algorithms, perform simulations, and benchmark the coding operations
on any platform where a C++ compiler is available. The library provide
a multitude of build blocks and parameters that can be combined in
order to create codes. To ensure ease of use several codes are
predefined, and high level API's provided.
